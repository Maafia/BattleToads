# BattleToads
An Hot Fix Update for the classic NES title, BATTLE TOADS! Fixing the infamous battle toads clinger winger glitch, but keeping the game vanilla! 

As its notoriously known, the Clinger Winger Glitch was released with the US version of the game, 2 players can not play through level 11 as the timer on Zitz is broken.
This patch fixes that, and adds the unused track into the game so that all stages have unique music too! 
Along with those 2 important changes, I created 2 extra patches for players who want to try to give battle toads a go for themselves.

# Instructions / How To Patch
Take your Battletoads (USA).nes Rom, click and drag it over the "windows-drag-here.bat" file,
and it should patch all the roms for you, they will sit in the folder called "Output". 
Note: If the rom doesnt work with the bat file, 
you might own the "headerless" rom, Get a different Rom (headered) and try again. 

# Version 1.1
This version leaves the OG NES Battletoads untouched, but with two changes:

-Player 2 can now move and complete "Clinger Wingers" (Infamous battle toads bug) 

-Adding the unused track to play on Terra tubes (so all levels have unique music)

IF you are already a hardcore battle toads player, this patch is for you.
# Modern
This version of the game is for new comers who want to still play and try to beat battle toads, but with the modern idea that Continues are infinite! 
Good luck attempting to beat this wonderful gem. 
Changes:

-INFINITE CONTINUES (As the name suggests, 
if battle toads was released today, it would have infinite continues, so thats what has been added)

-Player 2 can now move and complete "Clinger Wingers" (Infamous battle toads bug) 

-Adding the unused track to play on Terra tubes (so all levels have unique music)
# INFINITE
I wouldnt recommend this version, but I know there are many people out there who struggle with this game. 
This patch is for players who want to truck through the game at all means possible without repeating levels, 
as the name suggests, lives are plentyful in this mode (100 lives, 100 continues, thats 10,000 lives; you wont burn through them all I promise.)

Here are the changes:
-INFINITE LIVES (for people who want the easiest difficulty)

-INFINITE CONTINUES 

-Player 2 can now move and complete "Clinger Wingers" (Infamous battle toads bug) 

-Adding the unused track to play on Terra tubes (so all levels have unique music)
