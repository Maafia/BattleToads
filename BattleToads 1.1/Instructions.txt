Take your Battletoads (USA).nes Rom, click and drag it over the "windows-drag-here.bat" file,
and it should patch all the roms for you, they will sit in the folder called "Output". 
Note: If the rom doesnt work with the bat file, 
you might own the "headerless" rom, Get a different Rom (headered) and try again.
